## Installing the pnpm and packages

This repo uses the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) package manager, so you need to install it first.

Use the following command to install it globally:

<small>If you have `npm`</small>

```console
npm install -g pnpm
```

<small>If you have `yarn`</small>

```console
yarn global add pnpm
```

---

Then you can install the packages with:

```console
pnpm install
```

With that you will have all the packages installed in the root of the repo and all the projects inside this repo.
